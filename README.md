# ü§ñ Dual-Agent LLM Assistant for Data and Policy Queries

This project highlights my contribution to the development of an intelligent dual-agent chatbot system at Pezesha. The assistant was designed to handle both real-time data queries and internal policy-related questions by combining structured and unstructured retrieval approaches.

## üß† Key Components

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
  Implemented for retrieving relevant internal policy documents and delivering accurate, context-aware answers.

- **Modal Context Protocol (MCP):**  
  Used to connect one of the agents directly to BigQuery, enabling real-time data access via natural language queries.

- **LangGraph Architecture:**  
  Merged two independent agents‚Äîone specialized in structured data retrieval and the other in policy Q&A‚Äîinto a single cohesive assistant.

- **Credit Risk Modeling:**  
  Contributed to building credit scoring models using Random Forest and Linear Regression to assess borrower risk and support lending strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
